**Access Token** and **Refresh Token** are used in authentication and authorization mechanisms, particularly in stateless systems like JWT.

### **Access Token:**
- **Purpose:** Used to grant access to protected resources or APIs.
- **Expiration:** Typically has a short lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour) for security reasons.
- **Usage:** Sent with each request (usually in the `Authorization` header) to prove that the user is authenticated.
- **Structure:** Often a JWT that contains user information (claims) and an expiry time.
  
### **Refresh Token:**
- **Purpose:** Used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
- **Expiration:** Has a longer lifespan (e.g., days or weeks), but is stored securely (e.g., in cookies or local storage).
- **Usage:** Sent to a specific endpoint (like `/refresh`) to get a new access token when the old one expires, without requiring the user to log in again.
  
### Summary:
- **Access Token:** Short-lived, used for accessing resources.
- **Refresh Token:** Long-lived, used to get new access tokens when the previous one expires.
