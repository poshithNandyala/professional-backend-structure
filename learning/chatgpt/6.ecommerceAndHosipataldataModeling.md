To model data for an **e-commerce** system and a **hospital management** system using **Mongoose**, we need to understand the core entities, relationships, and workflows for each domain. Here’s a breakdown of how you can structure the data models for both systems.

---

### 1. **E-Commerce Data Modeling**

In an e-commerce system, some key entities are:
- **Users**: Customers who place orders.
- **Products**: Items available for purchase.
- **Orders**: Track customer orders.
- **Cart**: Items added by users before making a purchase.
- **Payments**: Tracks payment information for orders.

#### **User Schema**
This schema defines customer details, such as contact info, login credentials, and orders.

```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  address: {
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    postalCode: String,
    country: String
  },
  orders: [{ 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Order' 
  }],
  cart: [{ 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Cart' 
  }],
}, { timestamps: true });

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
```

#### **Product Schema**
This schema captures product details, such as name, price, and stock quantity.

```js
const productSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  price: { type: Number, required: true },
  stock: { type: Number, required: true }, // Track available stock
  category: { type: String },
  images: [String], // Array of image URLs
}, { timestamps: true });

const Product = mongoose.model('Product', productSchema);
```

#### **Order Schema**
The order schema tracks each order, including items, user details, and payment status.

```js
const orderSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'User', 
    required: true 
  },
  items: [{
    product: { 
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
      ref: 'Product' 
    },
    quantity: { type: Number, required: true },
    price: { type: Number, required: true }
  }],
  totalAmount: { type: Number, required: true },
  paymentStatus: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'failed'], default: 'pending' },
  orderStatus: { type: String, enum: ['processing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled'], default: 'processing' },
  shippingAddress: {
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    postalCode: String,
    country: String
  }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Order = mongoose.model('Order', orderSchema);
```

#### **Cart Schema**
Each user has a cart, containing items they want to purchase.

```js
const cartSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'User', 
    required: true 
  },
  items: [{
    product: { 
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
      ref: 'Product' 
    },
    quantity: { type: Number, required: true }
  }]
}, { timestamps: true });

const Cart = mongoose.model('Cart', cartSchema);
```

#### **Payment Schema**
Tracks payment details for an order.

```js
const paymentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  order: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Order', 
    required: true 
  },
  paymentMethod: { type: String, enum: ['credit_card', 'paypal', 'stripe'], required: true },
  paymentStatus: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'failed'], default: 'pending' },
  paymentDate: { type: Date }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Payment = mongoose.model('Payment', paymentSchema);
```

### 2. **Hospital Management Data Modeling**

For a hospital management system, key entities are:
- **Patients**: Individuals receiving medical care.
- **Doctors**: Medical professionals providing treatment.
- **Appointments**: Scheduled consultations between patients and doctors.
- **Medical Records**: Patient diagnosis, treatments, and prescriptions.
- **Invoices**: Billing for medical services.

#### **Patient Schema**
This schema tracks patient details, such as personal information and medical records.

```js
const patientSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number, required: true },
  gender: { type: String, enum: ['male', 'female', 'other'] },
  contactInfo: {
    phone: String,
    email: String,
    address: String
  },
  medicalRecords: [{ 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'MedicalRecord' 
  }],
  appointments: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Appointment'
  }]
}, { timestamps: true });

const Patient = mongoose.model('Patient', patientSchema);
```

#### **Doctor Schema**
The doctor schema tracks each doctor’s personal info, specialty, and appointments.

```js
const doctorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  specialization: { type: String, required: true },
  contactInfo: {
    phone: String,
    email: String,
    address: String
  },
  appointments: [{
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Appointment'
  }]
}, { timestamps: true });

const Doctor = mongoose.model('Doctor', doctorSchema);
```

#### **Appointment Schema**
Appointments link patients and doctors, recording the scheduled date, time, and diagnosis.

```js
const appointmentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patient: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Patient',
    required: true
  },
  doctor: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'Doctor',
    required: true
  },
  appointmentDate: { type: Date, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['pending', 'completed', 'cancelled'], default: 'pending' },
  diagnosis: { type: String }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Appointment = mongoose.model('Appointment', appointmentSchema);
```

#### **Medical Record Schema**
Stores the details of patient diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions.

```js
const medicalRecordSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patient: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Patient', 
    required: true 
  },
  doctor: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Doctor', 
    required: true 
  },
  diagnosis: { type: String, required: true },
  treatment: { type: String },
  prescriptions: [{ type: String }] // List of prescribed medications
}, { timestamps: true });

const MedicalRecord = mongoose.model('MedicalRecord', medicalRecordSchema);
```

#### **Invoice Schema**
Tracks the cost of medical services for a patient.

```js
const invoiceSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  patient: { 
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, 
    ref: 'Patient', 
    required: true 
  },
  amount: { type: Number, required: true },
  status: { type: String, enum: ['unpaid', 'paid'], default: 'unpaid' },
  paymentMethod: { type: String, enum: ['cash', 'credit_card', 'insurance'], required: true }
}, { timestamps: true });

const Invoice = mongoose.model('Invoice', invoiceSchema);
```

### Data Model Relationships

#### **E-Commerce**
- A **User** can have multiple **Orders**.
- An **Order** contains multiple **Products**.
- **Cart** is associated with a **User**, and contains **Products** that the user intends to purchase.

#### **Hospital Management**
- A **Patient** can have multiple **Appointments** and **Medical Records**.
- A **Doctor** can have multiple **Appointments**.
- **Appointments** are linked to both **Patients** and **Doctors**.
- **Invoices** are linked to **Patients**, with information about payment for medical services.

These data models represent essential entities and their relationships, providing a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient e-commerce and hospital management systems.
