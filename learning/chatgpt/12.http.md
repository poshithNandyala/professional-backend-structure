### HTTP Crash Course: HTTP Methods and Headers

**HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web. It defines a set of request methods and headers that allow communication between a client (like a browser or mobile app) and a server (like a backend API).

---

## 1. **HTTP Methods**

HTTP defines a set of methods (sometimes referred to as “verbs”) that indicate the action to be performed on a resource (like a web page, an API endpoint, etc.).

### Common HTTP Methods:

1. **GET**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieve data from the server.
   - **Example**: Fetching a list of users.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Should **not modify** any data.
     - Parameters are typically sent in the **URL** as query strings.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```http
     GET /users?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     ```

2. **POST**
   - **Purpose**: Submit data to the server (e.g., form submissions, creating new resources).
   - **Example**: Creating a new user.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Data is sent in the **body** of the request.
     - Typically used for operations that change data (non-idempotent).
   - **Example Request**:
     ```http
     POST /users HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
       "username": "poshith",
       "email": "poshith@example.com"
     }
     ```

3. **PUT**
   - **Purpose**: Update an existing resource or create a resource if it does not exist.
   - **Example**: Updating user details.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Like `POST`, data is sent in the **body**.
     - **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests should have the same effect.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```http
     PUT /users/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
       "username": "newUsername"
     }
     ```

4. **PATCH**
   - **Purpose**: Partially update a resource (as opposed to `PUT`, which updates the entire resource).
   - **Example**: Updating only the user's email.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Used when modifying **part** of a resource.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```http
     PATCH /users/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     Content-Type: application/json

     {
       "email": "newemail@example.com"
     }
     ```

5. **DELETE**
   - **Purpose**: Delete a resource from the server.
   - **Example**: Deleting a user account.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - **Idempotent**: If a resource has already been deleted, repeated requests will have no effect.
   - **Example Request**:
     ```http
     DELETE /users/1 HTTP/1.1
     Host: api.example.com
     ```

## 2. **HTTP Headers**

Headers provide additional context or metadata about the request or response. They are key-value pairs and can be used to convey information like the type of content being sent, authentication details, and caching preferences.

### Common HTTP Request Headers:

1. **Host**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the domain name of the server.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Host: api.example.com
     ```

2. **Content-Type**
   - **Purpose**: Tells the server the type of data being sent in the request body.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

3. **Authorization**
   - **Purpose**: Carries credentials to authenticate the client with the server (e.g., API tokens, Bearer tokens).
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Authorization: Bearer <token>
     ```

4. **User-Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Provides information about the client making the request (browser, version, etc.).
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/93.0.4577.63 Safari/537.36
     ```

5. **Accept**
   - **Purpose**: Informs the server about the types of media that the client can process.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Accept: application/json
     ```

6. **Cookie**
   - **Purpose**: Sends cookies from the client to the server.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Cookie: sessionId=abc123; theme=dark
     ```

7. **Referer**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the URL of the page that made the request.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Referer: https://example.com/previous-page
     ```

### Common HTTP Response Headers:

1. **Content-Type**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the type of the response body (e.g., `application/json` for JSON data, `text/html` for HTML documents).
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

2. **Set-Cookie**
   - **Purpose**: Sends cookies from the server to the client.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure
     ```

3. **Cache-Control**
   - **Purpose**: Directs caching behavior (e.g., how long the response should be cached).
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
     ```

4. **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource (used for CORS).
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
     ```

5. **Content-Length**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Content-Length: 348
     ```

6. **Location**
   - **Purpose**: Used in `3xx` redirects or when a resource is created to tell the client the new resource's location.
   - **Example**:
     ```http
     Location: /users/1
     ```

### 3. **Status Codes**

HTTP responses include status codes that indicate whether the request was successful, encountered a redirect, or resulted in an error. Here's a quick overview of the most common HTTP status codes:

- **1xx** (Informational): Request received, continuing process.
  - Example: `100 Continue`
  
- **2xx** (Success): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
  - Example: `200 OK`, `201 Created`
  
- **3xx** (Redirection): Further action must be taken to complete the request.
  - Example: `301 Moved Permanently`, `302 Found`
  
- **4xx** (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
  - Example: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `404 Not Found`
  
- **5xx** (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
  - Example: `500 Internal Server Error`, `502 Bad Gateway`

### 4. **Sample HTTP Flow:**

#### Request (GET)
```http
GET /api/users/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: application/json
```

#### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 128

{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "poshith",
  "email": "poshith@example.com"
}
```

### 5. **Conclusion**

- HTTP methods dictate the type of request (GET, POST, etc.).
- HTTP headers provide additional metadata and help with authentication, content negotiation, and more.
- HTTP status codes indicate the result of the request.

Mastering HTTP is crucial for working with web APIs and developing both front-end and back-end applications.
