To write sub-pipelines and routes in a MongoDB aggregation and a web framework like Express.js, it's important to know how to structure both aspects correctly. Let's break it down into **sub-pipelines** in MongoDB aggregation and how to **define routes** in Express.js.

### **1. Sub-Pipelines in MongoDB Aggregation**

In MongoDB, sub-pipelines are pipelines nested inside a `$lookup` stage (or other stages like `$facet`), where additional queries are applied to the related collection. These allow you to fetch and process related data in a more complex manner.

**Structure of a Sub-Pipeline**

Here's a basic template of using sub-pipelines in a `$lookup` for MongoDB aggregation:

```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            _id: ObjectId("USER_ID")
        }
    },
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "orders", // Collection to join
            localField: "_id", // Field from 'users' collection
            foreignField: "userId", // Field from 'orders' collection
            as: "userOrders", // Alias for the joined data
            pipeline: [ // Sub-pipeline
                {
                    $match: { // Condition to filter related documents
                        status: "active"
                    }
                },
                {
                    $lookup: { // Another lookup for related data (if needed)
                        from: "products",
                        localField: "productId",
                        foreignField: "_id",
                        as: "orderProducts",
                        pipeline: [ // Sub-pipeline inside lookup
                            {
                                $project: { // Limit product data
                                    name: 1,
                                    price: 1
                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                },
                {
                    $addFields: { // Modify or enrich the data
                        firstProduct: { $arrayElemAt: ["$orderProducts", 0] }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            name: 1,
            userOrders: 1 // Include the 'userOrders' in the final result
        }
    }
])
```

**Explanation**:
- `$match`: Finds a specific user.
- `$lookup`: Joins the `orders` collection related to the user and runs a sub-pipeline.
    - In the sub-pipeline, we match only the active orders, then look up the related `products` for each order.
    - We further use a sub-pipeline inside the second `$lookup` to project only the name and price of the products.
    - `$addFields`: Adds a custom field that includes the first product from the `orderProducts` array.

**When to use Sub-Pipelines**:
- When you need to join collections and apply additional filters or transformations to the joined data.
- When handling complex queries that require nested data manipulation.

### **2. Defining Routes in Express.js**

In Express.js, routes define the endpoints of your application, where clients can make requests. You can organize them using `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc., and even separate routes into modules for scalability.

**Basic Routes Setup in Express.js**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Sample Controller Methods (to be defined elsewhere)
const { getUserOrders, createOrder } = require('../controllers/orderController');

// GET route to fetch user orders
router.get('/user/:userId/orders', getUserOrders);

// POST route to create a new order
router.post('/user/:userId/order', createOrder);

module.exports = router;
```

**Controller Example**

```javascript
// Controllers handle logic
const getUserOrders = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const userId = req.params.userId;

        // MongoDB aggregation with sub-pipeline
        const orders = await Order.aggregate([
            {
                $match: { userId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId(userId) }
            },
            {
                $lookup: {
                    from: "products",
                    localField: "productId",
                    foreignField: "_id",
                    as: "productDetails",
                    pipeline: [
                        {
                            $project: {
                                name: 1,
                                price: 1
                            }
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]);

        res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            data: orders
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: error.message
        });
    }
};

const createOrder = async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { userId } = req.params;
        const { productId, quantity } = req.body;

        const newOrder = new Order({
            userId,
            productId,
            quantity,
            status: 'pending'
        });

        await newOrder.save();

        res.status(201).json({
            success: true,
            data: newOrder
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: error.message
        });
    }
};

module.exports = { getUserOrders, createOrder };
```

**Explanation**:
- **Router (`routes/orderRoutes.js`)**:
  - `GET /user/:userId/orders`: Fetches orders for a specific user by calling `getUserOrders`.
  - `POST /user/:userId/order`: Creates a new order by calling `createOrder`.
- **Controller (`controllers/orderController.js`)**:
  - `getUserOrders`: Uses aggregation with a sub-pipeline to fetch the user's orders along with related product details.
  - `createOrder`: Saves a new order to the database.

**Main App File (`app.js`)**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Import routes
const orderRoutes = require('./routes/orderRoutes');

// Middleware to parse JSON
app.use(express.json());

// Use routes
app.use('/api', orderRoutes);

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**How to Define Routes**:
1. **Define a Route in `router.js`**: Create your route paths (`/user/:userId/orders`) and link them to controller functions.
2. **Write Logic in Controllers**: Implement the logic (e.g., fetching or updating the database) in controllers.
3. **Mount the Router in the Main App**: Use `app.use()` in the main file to mount the routes (e.g., `/api/user`).

### **Bringing It Together: Sub-Pipeline with Routes**

When you combine both, your Express.js application can have routes that trigger MongoDB aggregation queries with sub-pipelines. This is useful when you need to query and transform complex data from multiple collections before returning it as a response.
